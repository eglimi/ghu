# Go Header Update

Go Header Update (ghu) replaces the beginning of a file with the content of
another file.

ghu is written in Go.

## Newlines

The file with the header content is expected to have no trailing newlines,
except the required ones. Beware of vim's eol feature.

## Use Case

ghu could be useful to replace header information in source code files.
